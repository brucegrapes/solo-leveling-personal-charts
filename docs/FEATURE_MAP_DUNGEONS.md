## 🎯 Overview

Introduce map-based, location-driven activities inspired by Pokémon Go to Solo Leveling Personal Charts. Users encounter random dungeons, gym activities, and location-based challenges, promoting real-world travel, exploration, and physical activity.

## 🧩 Feature Description

- **Random Dungeon Spawns:**
  - Dungeons appear at random real-world locations on the map.
  - Users must travel to these locations to "clear" dungeons for XP, loot, and badges.
  - Dungeons have time-limited availability and varying difficulty.

- **Gyms & Challenges:**
  - Real-world gyms (fitness centers, parks, or user-defined spots) act as competitive hubs.
  - Users can challenge gyms for leaderboard spots, special rewards, or to defend their title.
  - Group and solo challenges available.

- **Travel & Exploration:**
  - Encourage users to explore new areas, walk, or travel to participate in events.
  - Special rewards for visiting new locations or completing travel-based quests.

- **Map Integration:**
  - In-app map displays dungeons, gyms, and active challenges.
  - Privacy-first: location is opt-in, city-level only by default.

## 🧠 Psychological Perspective

- Leverages intrinsic motivation for exploration, novelty, and mastery.
- Physical anchoring increases satisfaction and habit formation.
- Social features (gyms, group challenges) drive engagement via competition and cooperation.
- Goal gradient effect: visible progress toward location-based goals boosts motivation.
- Caution: balance extrinsic rewards to avoid burnout or FOMO.
